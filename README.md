# Rubocop::SafeMigrations

Rubocop cops to help ensure that migrations are safer to run in production environments without causing downtime and database issues.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "rubocop-safe_migrations", require: false
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rubocop-safe_migrations

## Usage

After installed, you have to tell rubocop to require these new cops. For doing this, add this config to your .rubocop.yml file:

```yaml
require:
  - rubocop-safe_migrations
```

Be sure that you are not excluding migrate files for all cops either.

The cops that will be checked are:

- [`Migration/UpdatingDataInMigration`](#updating-data-in-migration)
- [`Migration/RenamingTableInMigration`](#renaming-table-in-migration)

### Updating data in migration

This cop will check if active record migrations have any method that runs updates, creations or deletions on your database.

This is important to be avoided if you have your deploy pipeline configured to run database migrations on deploy or build time.
Having data being manipulated or updated on deploy can cause unexpected downtime to your application database.

By default, all active record methods that generate update, create or delete queries are checked by the cop, and if used on migrations an offense will be generated.

To turn some method available to be used on migration, just add it to AllowedMethods config on rubocop.yml, for example:

```yaml
Migration/UpdatingDataInMigration:
  AllowedMethods:
    - toggle
```

Using the configuration above, the cop will not add an offense when the `toggle` method is used on migrations.

### Renaming table in migration

This cop will check if you have migrations that are renaming tables already created on your database.

This should be avoided because your tables can have triggers configured, that will stop working after the table gets renamed.
Besides that, it can lead to an inconsistent scenario where you will keep indexes and foreign_keys with the old table name,
and if a DBA or a developer see those in database, it can be confusing and create misunderstandings.

This cop has no options, the only thing that can be done is disabled it on rubocop.yml:

```yaml
Migration/RenamingTableInMigration:
  Enabled: false
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
